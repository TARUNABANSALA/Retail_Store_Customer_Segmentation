# Retail_Store_Customer_Segmentation
When conducting customer segmentation using K-means or any clustering technique, it's important to choose the right features (columns) that reflect customer behavior and characteristics. Here are some considerations for feature selection and data preprocessing:
Feature Selection:

Customer-related features: Focus on features that describe customer behavior and attributes. Relevant columns include 'customer_id,' 'segment,' 'city,' 'state,' 'country,' 'region,' and 'sales_year.'

Sales-related features: Columns like 'sales,' 'quantity,' 'discount,' 'profit,' 'shipping_cost,' and 'order_priority' can provide insights into customer purchase behavior, profitability, and preferences.
